BUILD AND RUN
=============

a) Use console
See build.xml for information on how to build with ant and run on the command
line.

b) Use Eclipe
Import this folder as a project and run from within.

ADD DEPENDENCIES
================

If you add dependcies to the classpath via Eclipse (ex: junit), please remember
to put the jar file into the lib directory. This enables ant to build correctly
from the command line, too. See build.xml for more details.
